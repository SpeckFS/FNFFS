Okay so I really hate some of these poses and the art style I chose for Lucy so I've done a bit of practice working with ACTUAL CURVES and NOT ENTIRELY STRAIGHT LINES SMH as well as some anatomy study so expect me to bang out an updated lucy sprite sheet in like the next week or something

Edited 7/4 oo shit happy 4th of July lol
