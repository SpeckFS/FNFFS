If you are looking for Lucy's .fla files, I'd hate to tell ya but-

She doesn't actually have any

(This also unfortunately goes for the bfsteam skin as swell as pretty much everything else in the mod)

I drew Lucy on my phone using ibisPaint and animated all of her sprites using OpenToonz, I don't have access to Adobe Flash so this was all the best I could do. That also of course means I don't have any of her animation files aside from her .xml and sprite sheet, and I have no idea if it's even possible to get a similar kind of thing to a .fla through OpenToonz. 

However,

I still have every single one of her assets saved, everything from her right hand in her idle animation all the way to the moving part of her coat in her right note animation.

If you want any of these assets for your own skin edits, animations, or whatever, feel free to dm me on my Twitter- @speckygb

I'll be happy to send you whatever you need! (As long as it is reasonable and appropriate for me)
