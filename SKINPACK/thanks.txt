Thank you so much for downloading my shitty mod! It means so much to me (even if you only got it for the skins)!

To use these skins, all you gotta do is find and replace the BOYFRIEND or GF_assets files with the ones in this folder and you're good to go! 

These skins SHOULD work in just about every mod (and base game of course), and you are free to do with them whatever you like, AS LONG AS YOU CREDIT ME

(Gf skins are currently in the works, offsets for both the standing version AND speaker version are still being handled by me, I'll get them out whenever I can)

































playable Lucy may or may not be made in the future

ill keep yall updated
