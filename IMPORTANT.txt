Note.txt files will appear everywhere lol gotta remember to delete them when its time to drop the mod

ALSO

If you are on another os other than Mac (yes I developed this on Mac) you'll probably need to compile the game lol

For people who don't know how to do that;

1. Go to your terminal/task manager/control panel/toolbar or whatever

2. CD into FNFFULLSTEAM

3. Type this in and run --->  lime test Mac

(Remember to replace 'Mac' with the name of your os!)

All this will only work if you have all the directories and stuff installed for haxe, lime, and Kade-engine, ninjamuffin and kadedev have really good guides on their GitHub pages on how to do this

Thres also some pretty good guides on gamebanana and tutorials from brightfyre that can help you understand how to start building fnf for your own mods
